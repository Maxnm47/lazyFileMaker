# lazyFileMaker
makes a dir with the given name, a react file and a css file and adds them all to the router. For lazy web developers.

Using the filemaker2.0, you can insert the pages you want into an array as example: page_names = ["home", "about", "contact"]
This creates a dir for each with a js file and css file with the respective names.
Additionally it creates a router for the files and adds each route. 

When you want to add another page, you can use appender2.0, simply exchange the new_page_name and run the script.
